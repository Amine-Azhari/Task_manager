Hello this is a simple first code the goal is to fully develop an application that manages my tasks for the day or the week also to manage my budget when spending money status : functional code, No interface, No database

News: I realized that, in order to link a data base, so this could be more useful I have to use SQL (sqlite3) I am new to SQL, as well as sqlite3 it took me some time to understand how to do basic things I got help from 'ChatGPT', he really is a good teacher & friend I am happy that now i can manage my tasks using my own app

Upcoming: add a deleting funcionnality (delete a task when finished)
